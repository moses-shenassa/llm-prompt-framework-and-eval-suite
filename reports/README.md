This folder will contain generated evaluation reports.

- **CSV**: raw per-example scores and metadata.
- **Markdown**: human-readable summary with aggregate metrics.
- **HTML**: simple HTML-wrapped version of the Markdown report.

Sample files are included in `reports/samples/` to show the expected format. When you run the evaluation harness, new reports will be created alongside these samples.
